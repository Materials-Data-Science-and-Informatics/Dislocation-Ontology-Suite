# Crystallographic Defect Module
Crystallographic Defect Ontology (CDO) is an ontology connecting the physical materials entity to the crystal structure and several defects in crystalline materials, e.g., point defect, line defect, plane defect, and bulk defect. In CDO, the `EMMO:Solid` and `EMMO:Crystal` class are reused to describe the physical entity of crystalline materials. The `CrystallineMaterial` class is subsequently a subclass of `EMMO:Solid` and an equivalent class of `EMMO:Crystal`.
