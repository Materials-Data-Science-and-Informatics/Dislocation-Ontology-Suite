# Dislocation Simulation and Model Ontology 

Dislocation simulation and model ontology (SIM) is an ontology developed to model various concepts and relationships in the discrete dislocation dynamics domain and microscopy techniques used in the dislocation domain. The various concepts are the numerical representation of dislocation applied in the dislocation dynamic simulation and the pictorial concept of pixel applied in representing dislocation in the experimental image, eg., TEM image, SEM image, and FIM image. Furthermore, the
