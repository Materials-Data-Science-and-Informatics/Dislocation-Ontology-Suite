# Dislocation Ontology Suite (DISOS)
This repository is a home to Dislocation Ontology Suite (DISOS), an ontology suite comprising several modules describing materials scientific concepts, representations of dislocations, simulation, and model in the dislocation domain. Currently, DISOS comprises four ontologies, including: 
* Dislocation Ontology ([DISO](./DISO))
* Crystal Structure Ontology ([CSO](./CSO))
* Crystallographic Defect Ontology ([CDO](./CDO))
* Dislocation Simulation and Model Ontology ([SIM](./SIM))

## Use cases
You may visit [here](./use-cases) to see how DISOS annotate dislocation-related data.
