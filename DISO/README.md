## About DISO
The dislocation ontology (DISO) is an ontology defining the concepts and relationships related to linear defects in crystalline materials. We developed DISO using a top-down approach in which we start defining the most general concepts in the dislocation domain and subsequent specialization of them. DISO is published through a persistent URL following W3C best practices for publishing Linked Data.

## Repository Description
* You may find the DISO with various formats: [rdf](./dislocation-ontology.owl), [turtle](./dislocation-ontology.ttl), [json-ld](./dislocation-ontology.jsonld), etc.
* We locate the folder related to data of dislocation microstructure [here](./data/)
    * [Dislocation microstructure of nickel material](./data/modelib-microstructure/modelib-nickel-microstructure.ttl) is the simulation data of dislocation microstructure of nickel (Ni) material generated by [MoDELib](https://github.com/giacomo-po/MoDELib)
* You may find a set of competence questions (CQs) along with SPARQL queries [here](./CQs/CQs_v1_1.md).
* [RDF genererator](/python-script/) is the folder to locate python scripts that are used to generate rdf-data from the [data](./data/).
    * To generate the RDF graph from the given [data](./data/), we use the [RDFLib](https://github.com/RDFLib/rdflib) python library.`
    * To generate the dislocation microstructure of nickel material, the script is in [here](./python-script/modelib/) and execute it with `python map_data.py`

## Documentation
To make it easier to understand and reuse our ontology, human-readable documentation of the ontology is generated and can be found [here](https://materials-data-science-and-informatics.github.io/Dislocation-Ontology-Suite/DISO/docs/index.html).
## Usage
* We recommend to use [Protégé 5.5.0](https://protege.stanford.edu/products.php#desktop-protege) to be able to view and navigate classes and properties in DISO.
* We recommend also to use HermiT as a reasoner for DISO. You can select it through the menu *Reasoner* in Protégé software.
